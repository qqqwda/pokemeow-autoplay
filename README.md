# Pok√©Meow autoplay README üöÄ

This Python application is designed to automate the process of catching Pokemons in the popular Discord game, Pok√©Meow. Utilizing Selenium and ChromeDriver.

## Updates üì¢
- **Captcha Solving Endpoint üß©**: An update has been made to include an endpoint for Captcha Solving. This feature is now fully operational!
- **New Captcha Solver API ‚ú®**: We are excited to introduce a new API for captcha solving! You can find it here: [PokeMeow Captcha Solver](https://rapidapi.com/qqqwda/api/pokemeow-captcha-solver). Please note that this service might operate with some delay. We are in the process of integrating this API in our new code version.

## Captcha Solver Accuracy and Latency ‚öôÔ∏èüïí
The captcha solver currently boasts around a 90% accuracy rate üéØ. However, expect some low latency due to hosting conditions üê¢. We are continuously working to improve this service for a smoother experience.

## Example Code üßë‚Äçüíª
Below is an example of how to implement the captcha solver in Python. 
Note that you need your own 'X-RapidAPI-Key' for authentication.

```python
import requests

url = "https://pokemeow-captcha-solver.p.rapidapi.com/predict"

# Replace 'captcha-file.png' with the path to your captcha image
files = { "file": open('captcha-file.png', 'rb') }
headers = {
    "X-RapidAPI-Key": "your-api-key-here",
    "X-RapidAPI-Host": "pokemeow-captcha-solver.p.rapidapi.com"
}

response = requests.post(url, files=files, headers=headers)
print(response.json())
```
