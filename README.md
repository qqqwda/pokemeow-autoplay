# ü§ñ PokeMeow autoplay

Python application designed to automate the process of catching Pokemons in the popular Discord game, PokeMeow. Utilizing the power of Selenium and ChromeDriver.
- I'll be updating this repo, in the future I will add an endpoint for Captcha Solving üß©
- New API for captcha solver: https://rapidapi.com/qqqwda/api/pokemeow-captcha-solver (Note: this might work slow)
  ```plaintext
  import requests
      
  url = "https://pokemeow-captcha-solver.p.rapidapi.com/predict"
      
  files = { "file": "open('captcha-file.png', 'rb')" }
  headers = {
  "X-RapidAPI-Key": "3fe858485cmsh4b09dad8226ecc6p149f14jsn799ac3bc7fb1",
  "X-RapidAPI-Host": "pokemeow-captcha-solver.p.rapidapi.com"
  }
      
  response = requests.post(url, files=files, headers=headers)
  print(response.json())
    ```
